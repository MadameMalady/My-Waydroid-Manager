# My Waydroid Manager    

My Waydroid Manager a work in progress Gtk4 application for installing and managing Waydroid installations.

My Waydroid Manager is a WORK IN PROGRESS and comes with absolutely no guarantee of being compatible with your use-case.

My Waydroid Manager should work to install Waydroid on the following platforms (with Gnome or Phosh DE):

Mobian 
Debian
Ubuntu
(**Manjaro** is a work in progress, and isn't fully implemented)

If you encounter issues with installing, please temporarily rename your hostname to either 'debian' , 'ubuntu' , or 'mobian' until 
your install is finished. (I am working on a better way to id linux distros reliably!)

**Please Do Not Ship**

  Flatpak builds are planned for release when the application is more feature-complete. 
  Official Flatpak builds will be published by myself when ready,
  for other packaging formats, please open an 'Idea' in the Discussions tab!
  I am only interested in Maintaining the Flatpak build long-tern, so if you'd like to volenteer
  to maintain other packaging formats, please do so when the Flatpak is shipped! 
  (ie: when the main functions are all complete)
  
Currently the 'Retrieve Registration Code' option isn't fully finished, please be patient as it's worked on.
